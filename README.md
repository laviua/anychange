This library gives an ability to make cross converting from one currency to another according to bid/ask rates with the different rates provider.

Motivation:
Make a dynamic calculation between several different currencies (fiat, crypto, etc), that's why I decided to use String instead of the "Currency" data type.

Please feel free to open issues, especially for fix in calculation.
Thanks
